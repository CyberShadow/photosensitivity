* Algorithm

- General goals:
  - Performance (usable to watch videos directly, without offline preprocessing)
  - No buffering (usable to watch streams without additional delay)
  - Usable generally (can be left on all the time, i.e. should not affect "good" input at all)
  - Should still allow keeping track of what's happening in the video at least to some degree even in "bad" fragments
    - Not enough to drop frames or duplicate last "good" frames
- General idea:
  - Define a function badness(frames), which will be called as a sliding window function over the frames
    - Goals:
      - Detect smooth but quick and repeated changes in brightness
        - Not enough to look at just the last frame
      - Detect red/green flashes
        - Not enough to average total luminosity ; look at each channel separately
      - Detect constant-frequency flashes
        - Not enough to look at just one frame X frames in the past
      - Detect objects rapidly flashing from one part of the frame to another
        - Not enough to look at any per-frame averages
      - Detect series of flashes (multiple flashes raise score)
        - Not enough to look at minimum/maximum values in frame history
      - Immune to single pixels changing their values (e.g. slow scrolling of hatch/dither textures)
        - Not enough to look at difference of individual pixels ; still need to aggregate them to some degree
      - Perform quickly enough to be usable in real time
    - Algorithm:
      - Split image into grid
      - Calculate average luminosity (per channel!) for each grid cell
      - Keep a running sum of the delta (absolute value of difference) between successive frames' corresponding grid cells
  - Do not allow badness(last frames) to exceed a certain threshold
    - If current frame pushes badness over the threshold, activate countermeasures and modify current frame (to keep resulting badness under threshold)
  
- For each frame:
  - Push to history
  - Update current badness
  - If badness exceeds threshold:
    - Edit frame
    - Update history and badness!
      - Unpush unedited frame
      - Push edited frame

* TODO

- [ ] Add pattern detection
- [ ] Use assembler for blending (refactor vf_framerate.asm)
- [ ] Use swscale?
  - [ ] reproduce goom's result, then retry with flags=area
- [ ] Change "skip" parameter to "max_samples"
